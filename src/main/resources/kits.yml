# This is a different type of kits approach. Instead of giving specific
# Item you give commands run by the console
# This means that you can give the player items
# But also do commands that the player has no permission for
# Just remember that they are run from the console side so if they
# can't be run from the console it wont work.
#
# Tips and info:
#
# You can run a command from the players side with the use of the command 'sudo [player] [command]'
# use '@p' to access the player that executed the kit command
#
# Don't forget to put either "" quotes or '' single quotes around the text. Otherwise it wont work.
#
# Examples:
#
# Give the player some stone
# stone:
#   - 'give @p stone 64'
#
# Make the player go home and say I have gone home
# GoHome:
#   - 'sudo @p I have gone home'
#   - 'sudo @p /home'
