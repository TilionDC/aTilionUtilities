# You can have different rules for different worlds
# Just set the world and then rules as a list
# Just like this:

#   - "Don't steal"
#   - "No griefing"
# -
# world_nether:
#   - "No destroying spawners"
#   - "rule 2 etc"
# -
# For global rules put
# global:
# if the current world doesn't exist it will go to global
# Do &[1-9 and a-f] to give chatcolors to the rules. The & represents the color prefix
